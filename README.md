# Problem
Every city in the world is facing problem of traffic congestion. Instead of investing any furthur resources (more bridges, widen roads, etc), If city can manages our existing resources effeciently, city traffic department can avoid the prolem of traffic congestion. So with the help of traffic data- data driven insights on traffic data is providing to city traffic department to solve the problem.


<b>Motivation</b>  In the city of Chicago there is an one way reversible express lane(speed limit= 70mph) that opens for traffic towards the city on morning and in evening it opens away from the city to traffic.
On Mondays through Fridays, reversible express lanes from the inbound direction to outbound travel between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., depending on traffic conditions. Sundays through Fridays, the outbound reversibles are switched to the inbound direction between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.

This motivated me to provide the data driven insights to city traffic department to use the existing resourses effeciently.
